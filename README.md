# Project Motivation
This project is my first data mining project for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.
For all prospective Airbnb hosts in Seattle, I was interested in the following questions
1. When are typically listings available?
2. What is the distribution of the listing price?
3. Can we predict the price of a new listing based on some of its attributes?
4. What factors make the most difference in terms of pricing?
5. Whatâ€™s the review score for each listing?

# File Descriptions
There are three files in the dataset, which was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle)
listings.csv - includes full descriptions and average review score
calendar.csv - includes listing id and the price and availability for that day
reviews.csv - includes unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments We'll be using all three files individually for analysis.

The main analysis and data exploration can be found [here](https://github.com/sunnychen123/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/Seattle_Airbnb_Data.ipynb)

# Results
The whole article can be found through a Medium post publicly available through [here](https://yaqingchen5.medium.com/airbnb-in-seattle-data-analysis-2f50eb57934b)
