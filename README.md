# Installation
- Pands (for data loading and analysis). Numpy (for computing)<br>
- Matplotlib (for visualization)<br>
- Seaborn (for visualization)<br>
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)<br>
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit for analysis of descriptions and reviews)<br>
- Jupyter (to run notebooks)

# Project Motivation
This project is my first data mining project for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.
For all prospective Airbnb hosts in Seattle, I was interested in the following questions:
1. When are typically listings available?
2. What is the distribution of the listing price?
3. Can we predict the price of a new listing based on some of its attributes?
4. What factors make the most difference in terms of pricing?
5. What’s the review score for each listing?

# File Descriptions
There are three files in the dataset, which were downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).<br>
listings.csv - includes full descriptions and average review score<br>
calendar.csv - includes listing id and the price and availability for that day<br>
reviews.csv - includes unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments<br> 

We'll be using all three files individually for analysis, the main analysis and data exploration can be found [here](https://github.com/sunnychen123/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/Seattle_Airbnb_Data.ipynb).

# Results
The whole article can be found through a Medium post publicly available through [here](https://yaqingchen5.medium.com/airbnb-in-seattle-data-analysis-2f50eb57934b).
